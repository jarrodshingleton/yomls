WARNING: IF YOU ARE NOT JARROD, PLEASE DISREGARD.  THIS AREA IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

**Just delete all the stuff below and add your explanations***

Oh, and don't forget to adjust the front matter - dates and things.

Here are the materials I used:

* **Good Paint**
* **It was yellow**
* **Just Kidding, I didn't paint this picture.** It's good though.

The `courses` folder may be renamed. For example, we can rename it to `docs` for software/project documentation or `tutorials` for creating an online course.

## The next step in painting.

**This is a cool picture.**
