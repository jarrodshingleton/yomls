Last week, one of my coworkers was asked to analyse some survey data. Unfortunately, much of that survey data was in the form of the dreaded pdf (portable document format, if you were ever curious). Now, sometimes pdf is not that difficult to deal with, when it is a small amount, like just one table. But, what is you have multiple pages and tables and things to take out of the pdf in question? That is what we are going to cover here.

Okay, first, I need a pdf to read. For this example, we are going to be reading in a file called sample.pdf I downloaded from http://www.africau.edu/. It is a very uncomplicated pdf that will serve nicely for this demonstration. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
