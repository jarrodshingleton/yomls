<p>(Logistic Regressions) Overview</p>
<p>In this practical exercise, you'll first run through a logistic regression exercise on a small, well-known dataset so that you can see how to use the code to develop a logistic regression model. Let's get started.</p>
<div id="step-1-set-up-r-environment-for-lecture-example-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 1: Set up R environment for Lecture Example Analysis</h1>
<p>First, as usual, set the working directory.</p>
<p>setwd()</p>
<p>Remember, if you can't get the setwd (set working directory) function to work, try ?setwd to get some additional help.</p>
<p>Since we'll be conducting two different analyses for this practical exercise (including the take home lab), you'll need to create a new script file for the class examples. For this week, we will work on classifications, so let's make a new R file called &quot;LectureExampleData2&quot; for In-Class lab and &quot;LabExampleData2&quot; for the Take-Home Lab.</p>
<p>This week, we will use the R packages <em>ggplot2</em>, <em>gridExtra</em>, and <em>caret.</em> You need to install them by using the <em>install.packages()</em> function.</p>
<p>To begin, we will clear our current workspace (get rid of any saved variables) and load a few packages that we'll use for the example analysis. Cut and paste the following commands into your new script file and run them:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rm(list=ls())  ##clears the environment

## Library for An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R
library(ISLR)

## Libraries for Plotting our Results
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

## Library for confusion matrix
library(caret)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: lattice</code></pre>
<p>Note that if you look in the &quot;Environment&quot; window in your upper right hand column, all of the objects you created with your previous code have been erased from memory. You are restarting with a blank slate.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-2-load-visualize-and-split-training-vs.-test-data-sets" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 2: Load, Visualize, and Split (Training vs. Test) Data Sets</h1>
<p>Now, let's bring in the dataset that we'll be working with for the example. this is a simulated datasheet titled &quot;Default&quot; containing information on ten-thousand credit customers provided in <em>ISLR</em>. We will use the &quot;Default&quot; dataset to illustrate the concept of classification by fitting several different machine learning models to the data over the course of several practical application exercises. For these examples, we will develop models to &quot;predict whether an individual will default on his or her credit card payment, on the basis of annual income and monthly credit card balance.&quot; (James et al, 2013, p. 128).</p>
<p>&quot;Default&quot; dataset is in the &quot;ISLR&quot; library.</p>

<p>Looking at the data, you will see that the response variable stored in the column &quot;default&quot; which indicates whether or not a person defaulted on their payment. There is a categorical variable titled &quot;student&quot; indicating student status and two numeric variables, &quot;balance&quot; and &quot;income.&quot;</p>
<p>Let's plot the data based on the two numeric attributes to get a sense of what the data looks like using the <em>ggplot2</em> package. take careful note of how we use various aesthetics to change the formatting of the plot (color, shape, etc.):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## Plot the actual data
plotData &lt;- ggplot(data = Default,
       mapping = aes(x = balance, y = income, color = default, shape = student)) +
    layer(geom = &quot;point&quot;, stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;identity&quot;) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c(&quot;No&quot; = &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot; = &quot;red&quot;)) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.key = element_blank()) +

plotData</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/logistic_regression/Logistic-Regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We have seen <em>ggplot2</em> before so this should be at least a little familiar. If you want to know more on <em>ggplot2</em>, type &quot;?ggplot2.&quot;</p>
<p>We can see in the plot above that there is no &quot;clean break&quot; or simple rule that divides those that default from those that don't. We will try several different modeling approaches to find a best policy over the next few practical application exercises.</p>
<p>Before we begin fitting models, we need to break the data into a train and a test Dataset. We will split the Default dataset into a training dataset that includes 9-% of the observations and a test dataset that includes 20% of our observations. We do this by generating a sample of index values and then pulling data out of the Default dataframe based on the sample.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Partition of data set into 80% Train and 20% Test datasets
set.seed(123)  # ensures we all get the sample sample of data for train/test

<div id="setp-3-fit-a-logistic-regression-model" class="section level1">
<h1>Setp 3: Fit a Logistic Regression Model</h1>
<p>The code blocks below fit two different logistic regression models. The first one uses R's shorthand notation of a period for fitting a model using all features (response variable ~.). The second model uses only the two numeric predictors, and uses the <em>scale()</em> command to center the scale on the numeric data. The summary command provides a summary of the model fit (as discussed in the lecture).</p>
<p>Notice that we are using the <em>glm</em> function and not the <em>lm</em> function, but to use this, we need to tell the function what type of model we want to fit. If you set &quot;family&quot; to &quot;gaussian,&quot; you would get normal linear regression.</p>
<p>To use the glm() function for logistic regress, you have to set the parameter &quot;family = binomial(link=&quot;logit&quot;).&quot;</p>

<p>We can see that the first model using all of the predictors provides a better fit (as we would expect). However, better fit on the training data often does not necessarily lead to a better model fit on out of sample test data. Selecting the subset of features that provides the best model is a large (unsolved) problem in data science, but there are some algorithmic procedures for doing so that provide some benefit. We'll use one automated procedure called stepwise modeling below.</p>

<p>Once the code runs, you can see that the model selected using The stepwise procedure uses only two of the predictors variables: student (a categorical Yes/No variable) and balance (a numeric variable). Now, let's take a quick look at model performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-5-visualization-and-performance-of-model" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 5: Visualization and Performance of Model</h1>
<p>Now that we've picked a model, let's add the predictions made to our dataset. We evaluate performance on the &quot;held out&quot; test dataset (i.e. data that wasn't used to fit the model). The code block below creates a version of the Test dataset for plotting purposes and adds the resulting predictions to the dataframe. The column &quot;predProbLogit&quot; adds the probability calculated by the final logit model for each observation in the test dataset. The column &quot;predClassLogit&quot; adds the resulting prediction on the test dataset when the value 0.5 is used as the classification threshold. We again use the <em>summary()</em> command to get a quick look at the resulting data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Put the predicted probability and class (at 0.5 threshold) at the end of the dataframe

<p>Evaluating the performance of the model on the training dataset above, we can see that the model does a pretty good job of predicting overall, but that it isn't very good at identifying when someone is going to default at the classification threshold of 0.5. The model correctly predicts only 20 out of 66 of the people who will default at that threshold. As we will discuss further in the course, we may want to adjust our threshold depending on our problem and we may want to try to find a better-performing model (more to follow). However, the exercise above provides a code example for fitting a logistic regression model that can be adapted for our practical application problem.</p>
<p>Before moving on, perform the following actions to save your work and prepare for the practical application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Save your workspace as &quot;LectureExampleData2.RData&quot; (By typing save.image(“LectureExampleData1.RData”) function)</li>
