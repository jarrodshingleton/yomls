## How tutorials are organized

Here you can find Articles and Tutorials on various popular machine learning (and statistical learning, if you want to be technical) techniques. 

We try to include both R and Python code where possible. But the main thing we try to show are the best types of data structures on which the various techniques are best used. 

Also, we do our best to use real world problems, answering real world questions, so that we can address some of the problems you may not encounter in those pesky textbooks from your statistics class. :smile:
