## Overview and Refresher

Quick Refresher on the awesome machine learning algorithm:

* **Some math**
* **types of data to use this on**
* **Be cautious - some things to keep in mind...**

The basic `math` and concept here.

## Best types of Data

**Data to use and structure it works best on.**

## Considerations

Some things to think about when doing this super awesome machine learning.

This is how you put in code blocks:

```toml
[[main]]
  name = "Courses"
  url = "courses/"
  weight = 50
```
