In this tutorial, talk about a serious problem:

## Intro the Problem

Here's the problem.

## Some Data

Here's some data


And some more data.


Trying to make this long.


## Cleaning

Let's get the data ready for the algorithm we are going to use to answer the main questions in the problem.

## Simple Algorithm

Let's run a simple algorithm as a baseline.

## Our ML Algorithm

Now, let's run the main event.

## Comparison

Compare results to the baseline. 

## Main Insights and Conclusions

If we have any...

## Wrap Up

And that's how we use R to implement this algorithm on this data set.  And why.
