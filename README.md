## Making a Blog Post

Two ways to make a blog post:

1. Write your entire blog post in a markdown file. Then send the .md file and any illustrations, figures, or pictures to the administrators. We will edit the files only enough to work on our site and publish. (If we need to make any editorial changes to the content, we will make sure we talk to you first.)

2. Write your blog post in RMarkdown. send us the .rmd file and any relevant data (plus any pictures you may want included...) and we will render, edit it, and post it! (Same disclaimer about editorial changes.)

3. Write your blog post in Rmarkdown, render it yourself to a markdown (.md) file, and send us the .md file, any rendered illustrations, figures, or pictures and we will post it! (Again, with the disclaimer about editorial).
